Devoid of reason and thought
With Cloning technology
Both defter and sinister
Now irritrivably lost
With my utmost devosion
With my corrupt congressman
The great power of money
An optimistic outlook
I have checkmate in two moves
We do as the heart desires
Holding back their angry tears
Close enough to feel it pass
Believed that all would be right
On a saturday evening
Quickly now, to the restroom
A vile bloodcurtling nightmare
In the end it matters not
Some day the momment will come
In a mechinized body
You've no respect for the flow
Alone wihtout companions
In the guise of a young child
Inheretence of technique
I prostrate myself and beg
Aggresive hair removal
Sorry, it's via e-mail
Prepare to open my stomach
A mind consumed with chagrin
With someone elses money
There can be no higher stakes
The fly is completly open
Though you were my best friend
Flying at the speed of light
