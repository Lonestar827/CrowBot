we know that life is
I remove my clothes
I rise with the sun
The Truth is out there
My centennial
In this August year
When one nears fourty
At the break of dawn
Mother Gorilla
Now in succession
This is the culprit
Even now with this
This autumnal count
Amazonian
In deepest darkness
Even the leader
Unprecidented
On a vacation
So mediocre
Enthusiasm
When the lights go out
Crying and shouting
Under the heavens
A vicious attack
Though i may be bored
Deep within your heart
What is now shocking
So fasinating
Stay out of the way
Every now and then
Nigh impregnatble
You, cease and desist
Give it your best shot
