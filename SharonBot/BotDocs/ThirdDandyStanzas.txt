Into an overhead throw
America's best
Drenched in heavy sweat
Fight among themselves
Grab at ancient coins
I journey alone
Keeps me warm all night
A waste of money
Speak a dead language
I follow my dream
To live in exile
Lets go commando
Dramatic comic
A short vacation
Begging for more life
With multiple wives
The revolution
Now he drinks alone
Such backhanded praise
At home on new years
Find a technition
Sing Hail to the Chief
Hunter is hunted
An erotic peak
The kings champion
Robotic shogun
With my alian
The silent treatment
More then meets the eye
Bragging of bad luck
He self destructed
Beyond primevil
Happilly bankrupt
