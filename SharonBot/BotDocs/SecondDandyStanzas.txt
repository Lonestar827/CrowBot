Devoid of reason and thought
With cloning technology
Both defter and sinister
Now irretrievably lost
With my utmost devotion
With my corrupt congressman
The great power of money
An optimistic outlook
I have checkmate in two moves
We do as the heart desires
Holding back their angry tears
Close enough to feel it pass
Believed that all would be right
On a Saturday evening
Quickly now, to the restroom
A vile bloodcurdling nightmare
In the end it matters not
Someday the moment will come
In a mechanized body
You've no respect for the flow
Alone without companions
In the guise of a young child
Inheritance of technique
I prostrate myself and beg
Aggressive hair removal
Sorry, it's via e-mail
Prepare to open my stomach
A mind consumed with chagrin
With someone elseâ€™s money
There can be no higher stakes
The fly is completely open
Though you were my best friend
Flying at the speed of light
